        <h2>About You</h2>
        <p>
            In my eyes you are a rare find in a world of regular folks. Your eyes are deep and mysterious, like the night sky, and your smile can light up even the gloomiest of my days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being around you feels like a cozy blanket on a chilly nightâ€”comforting and reassuring. Your a reminder that real beauty comes from the inside, from the kindness, strength, and love you shares.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Adventures</h2>
        <p>
            The day I met you I began to forget a life without you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back in 2017, during our grade 7 days, I vividly recall the first time I spotted you in the school hallway. Your eyes, as deep and dark as night, seemed to beckon my soul, while your face radiated with a brilliance akin to the sun, nearly blinding my eyes. At that time, I didn't quite understand what love was, and all I thought was, "What a beautiful girl." Little did I know that as time passed, my affection for you would blossom, growing deeper with each passing day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward to 2018, when we were in grade 8, luck was on my side because your room was right in front of my section. I had the privilege of seeing you every day, during recess when you bought food, and when it was time to head home. It was during this year that I mustered the courage to blurt out your name, confessing my crush on you. Your friend, Princess Jyn, took it upon herself to tease me relentlessly, and my friends Reymark and Sid joined in, until I had no choice but to add your Facebook account and send you a message. Fortunately, you accepted my request and responded to my messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back then, you had a boyfriend, but I couldn't stop myself from messaging you. I should have known better, considering the troubles you and your boyfriend were going through. I didn't want to be the reason for any more problems, but when I read your messages about your relationship, a strong determination surged within me: "I want to protect this girl."
        </p>
         <p>
            Every night that day we kept on messaging each other until our hearts became closer and closer then one night i confess to you and you accepted it i was so happy that day that i could go to moon and back to earth. that day and so on everyday was blessing to me to have you by my side was the best things that happened to my life I sometimes think God made you for me. i think to myself "how is it possible, thay a guy with my faults, flaw and and habits, found an angel like you?"I only have few close friends and you can count them by the fingers, I never used to let people come too close and then there was you , that came in and settled in the depths of my soul. I shared with you the parts of me which i never even shared with myself before. every moment with you was a blessing.
        </p>
         <p>
            The pandemic hit, and then that dreaded day came when my parents found out about us. You know, they're incredibly strict, and they wouldn't even let me go out with my closest friends without a solid reason. They insisted I was too young to have a girlfriend, so they basically told me I had to break up with you. It was a tough call, but I thought it was the right thing to do to avoid causing more hurt. I'm so sorry because I didn't explain properly why I had to do it. I just kind of disappeared, and I know you cried a lot that night. My heart ached, and I regretted it deeply. That rainy day felt as heavy as my heart.
        </p>
         <p>
            Many months later, I finally mustered the courage to try and fix things. I asked my close friend Pabi to explain why I broke up with you and whether it was okay to message you again. You said it was, and we patched things up. But a few days later, we broke up once more because you said your family wasn't on board with our relationship. I understood, having felt that sense of hopelessness too. It's like watching your most precious treasure being taken away right in front of you.
        </p>
         <p>
            A few more months went by, and I heard that you'd found someone new. I sighed in relief, thinking you'd moved on. But I also worried about the mark I might've left on you. A friend showed me a picture of you on Facebook, and when I saw your eyes and that radiant smile, it brightened my day. I thought, "Maybe she's better off without me," but it still hurt because I couldn't be there to share in your laughter, joy, and even the tough times.
        </p>
         <p>
            Knowing I couldn't be with you, I distracted myself by diving into video games. They worked as a temporary escape. Then came graduation day when we finished junior high, and I saw you on stage, as beautiful as ever. It was like watching a beautiful but painful sunset. 
        </p>
         <p>
            When I transferred schools and moved to Butuan City, it was challenging because I had no friends here, and I feared I wouldn't adapt to this new environment. But I pushed through, and it turned out better than I expected. To top it off, I heard from your friend Claire that you had also moved to Butuan City. Knowing we're in the same city brought joy to my heart.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Its been such a long time since i've heard from you. I forgot every detail of your face, the sound of your voice and your laugh, it feels so unfamiliar now. But I still wonder if you still think about me on random days because I still do. Our memories still play in my head as if it was just yesterday. Every day, I wake up with thoughts of you and go to bed with dreams of you. You've become the most beautiful part of my life, and I can't imagine a future without you in it. Until now I still haven't deleted our conversation, So when I miss you I can still read our old conversations, I can still hear your voice messages, I can still look at the pictures you sent, But that only makes me miss you even more And there's nothing I can do. Im so glad you were born so that i could know you. It's enough for me to be sure that you and i exist at this moment. 
        </p>
         <p>
            Some friends told me to move on, but how do I move on when I've never felt this way about anyone else? You made me feel loved and special, even though I know we're not a thing anymore, and you might have forgotten me. It sounds crazy, but I can't seem to develop feelings for anyone else since our breakup. You were different from everyone else I've known. If I could go back in time, I'd knock some sense into my past self to avoid the mistakes I made. Even if you're reading this, I want to say I'm sorry for everything. I miss you deeply because I've never felt at home with anyone else but you. So, if fate ever brings us back together, I'll gladly wait for you. I love you till the end. 
        </p>
         <p>
            My Love, you are worth it all.
        </p>
